So here I am, setting up a personal website. I had WordPress.com blog a few
years ago. I guess I technically still have it, but I haven't done anything
with it, nor do I intend to return to it.

Anyway, with this site, I'm planning on posting about things that cross my mind
that I feel warrant a post, as well as, and probably more importantly,
documenting various projects of mine. This website itself is the [first] of
those projects.

[first]: /projects/8bittree-net

I decided to go with a static site generator to build 8bittree.net. After
looking at few options, including [Jekyll], [Hyde], [Acrylamid], [nanoc] and
[Hakyll], I ended up going with [Middleman]. Incidentally, I think Middleman was
the first one I stumbled on, though at the time, I hadn't decided what kind of
software I was going to use to build my site, or even what a static site
generator was. My decision was mostly driven by Middleman having a mostly bare
bones base setup with lots of customizability and some decent documentation, as
well as me being able to get it working at all in a fairly short period of time.
I actually do think the documentation could use some fattening, but there
fortunately is something of a community around it that can help answer your
questions if the documentation doesn't.

[Hyde]: https://hyde.github.io/
[Acrylamid]: http://posativ.org/acrylamid/
[nanoc]: http://nanoc.ws/
[Hakyll]: http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/
[Middleman]: http://middlemanapp.com/

In case you're wondering what a static site generator is, it's simply a tool
that creates html files based on provided templates and places them in
appropriate directories within a root folder. Then you just need to point your
webserver at the root server and you should be ready to go. Since it spits out
completed html files, there's no need for a database or dynamic page server.
Being able to use template files with languages such as Haml and Markdown makes
writing the site a lot easier than doing all the html by hand, especially if
you've got things that need to be included in multiple pages.

I still need to do a fair amount of work here. I'd like to set up a comment
system, on the off chance anybody reads something here and decides they'd like
to say something. Setting up relative to now post dates would be a nice
addition. And the page layouts will probably receive some more tweaking.

This website is open source. You can check it out on [Bitbucket] or [Github].
